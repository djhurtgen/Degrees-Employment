Analysis of bachelor's degrees conferred along with employment data over time

As someone who will attain a 2nd baccalaureate in December after having attained a first in 1995, I thought it would be interesting to look at changes in college degrees conferred by field of study over as large a span as I can gather data on. If possible, I’d like to compare this data in tandem with employment data on college graduates. Some of the specific questions I hope to answer include “What fields have undergone the largest positive or negative percentage change in number conferred?”, and “Do employment statistics on college graduates reflect the number of degrees conferred by major in any way?” The most relevant data I’ve found to date comes from the National Science Foundation and National Center for Education Statistics (see below). These tables don’t contain shared attributes, so any direct combining of the data is unlikely, but I hope to glean some insight between the two through analysis and graph visualization. (They also cover varying spans of time, though there is an overlap of 16 years between them.) As the employment data includes information on race, ethnicity, and gender, I will likely break down trends by these attributes.
